									<h1>Experience that Bridges<br />

								<p>With a rare blend of instructional expertise and hands-on security experience, I bring a people-centered, process-driven approach to cybersecurity. My career began in public education, where I honed the art of clear communication, critical thinking, and curriculum development. These skills now serve me well in the cybersecurity field, where I specialize in threat detection, incident response, and the continual improvement of security operations.</p>
								<p>At Agriscape, a medium-sized agricultural services company, I was responsible for configuring, managing, monitoring, and securing the network infrastructure—including switches, firewalls, and NAC systems. I managed third-party vendors providing critical business services, ensuring secure integrations and appropriate access controls. I also oversaw systems containing sensitive employee data, implementing safeguards to meet compliance standards and reduce organizational risk. In addition to providing Level III support for network and security issues, I led the deployment of new solutions and trained personnel to ensure effective adoption and long-term sustainability. Supporting a lean IT team, I prioritized tasks under minimal supervision, maintained documentation in project and ticketing systems, and regularly informed leadership of blockers—offering actionable recommendations to keep initiatives on track.</p>
								<p>This foundation gave me a strong appreciation for the operational demands of growing businesses—where every security decision must support both protection and performance. I brought this mindset into my current role at Viatris, a global pharmaceutical company, where for the past year I've served in Incident Response and Threat Intelligence as a student worker while completing my master’s degree. Here, I’ve leveraged enterprise-grade tools to detect, investigate, and contain threats in a complex and highly regulated environment. I’ve developed and tuned detection rules, created MITRE ATT&CK-aligned playbooks, and built automated workflows using Falcon Fusion and PowerShell to enrich investigations, gather forensic evidence, and accelerate incident response. Working alongside threat intelligence and engineering teams, I’ve helped shape response processes that support both rapid containment and long-term risk reduction.</p>
								<p>My earlier career as a public educator shaped not only my communication style, but my ability to empower others through knowledge. I’m known for developing clear, actionable documentation that improves onboarding, cross-team collaboration, and incident response efficiency. Whether I’m writing SOPs, mentoring new analysts, or contributing to open-source detection projects, I lead with a commitment to knowledge sharing, empathy, and operational excellence.</p>
								<p>Having worked across environments of vastly different scale—from a family-run business to a global enterprise—I understand how security needs shift with growth, and how to adapt strategies to fit. I believe the most impactful security programs are those built collaboratively, designed for real-world complexity, and grounded in a deep understanding of both human behavior and business priorities.</p>
